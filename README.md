The experience of booking movie tickets is often a problem due to the long queues experienced in theaters. In order to improve the convenience of moviegoers in booking tickets, a web-based application called “PesenPilem” was created. In this web application, users can view movies that are currently showing, available seats for a movie, and the history of ticket booking transactions.
